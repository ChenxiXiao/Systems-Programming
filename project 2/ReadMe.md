## CPE357 Project 2

Write a program that will return a sorted list of the n most common words in a file or set of files, sorted by order of frequency. In the case of a frequency tie, words later in the alphabet take precedence over words earlier. (That is, sort first on numbers, then on the words in lexographical order, but we’re printing “bigger” things first so the words will wind up in reverse alphabetical order.)

_Sample Run_

% fw nonexistant
nonexistant: No such file or directory
The top 10 words (out of 0) are:

% fw -n fishsticks
usage: fw [-n num] [ file1 [ file 2 ...] ]
