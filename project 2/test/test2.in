Oh wooooah 3x

You know you love me, I know you care,
you shout whenever and I'll be there.
You are my love, you are my heart
and we will never ever ever be apart.
Are we an item? girl quit playing,
were just friends, what are you saying?
Said there's another and look right in my eyes,
my first love broke my heart for the first time.
And I was like

Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Oh, for you I would have done whatever,
and I just can't believe we aint together
and I wanna play it cool but I'm losing you
I buy you anything, I buy you any ring,
And I'm in pieces, Baby fix me
And just shake me til' you wake me from this bad dream.
I'm going down down down down
and I just can't believe my first love won't be around.
And I'm like

Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us who could ever come above
She had me going crazy, oh I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound
I skip a beat when I see her in the street
And at school on the playground
But I really wanna see her on a weekend
She know she got me dazin' 'cause she was so amazin'
And now my heart is breakin' but I just keep on sayin'

Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Now I'm all gone
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Now I'm all gone
Now I'm all gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I'm gone
